There’s 4 possible options:
1-if the first number =even, second numbers=odd => then shift and add with the first number
2-if the first number=even, second number is=even =>shift as much as the number of dividened of the number to 2
3-if the first number=odd, second number=even=>shift as much as the number of dividened by division of the number to 2
4-if the first number=odd, second number=odd=>shift and add with the first number

MOV DL,2

SHR DL,1 ;CHECK IF THE NUMBER IS EVEN OR ODD BY DIVID ON 2 AND CHECK THE REMAINDER
MOV DL,CL       ;STORE IT TO KNOW HOW MUCH SHOULD i SHIFT
CMP DL,0 ;IF THE REMAINDER IS 0=>ONE OF THE NUMBERS IS EVEN SO IT CAN BE SHIFTED FOR MULTIPLICATION
